# CPP2023-2-SimPassing

The following task is implemented within the application:

> Simulation of passing in mathematics 

> There are tasks - quadratic equations written in the input file. Students solve them and send the answers to the teacher. The teacher has a queue of letters for verification in the format “square equation + solution + student name”. 

> Students are good - they always solve problems correctly, average - they have a chance to solve the problem correctly, but they can make mistakes, and bad - they always write that the root is one and this is 0. 

> The teacher can check all the letters from the queue after the credit weeks and write down the name of the student and the number of successfully solved problems in the table. 

>The teacher can publish the progress table.
